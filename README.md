# Svelte based webapp with Asian Deities
Travelers from non-Asian cultures who travel to Asia often see Gods statues unknown to them. In Asian theology (both Buddhism and Hinduism) there are many diffent deities each with their own human or non-human form. Most tourists identify these simply as Buddha, but this is often false. 

I want to inform people about Asian theology using the rich collection from the Dutch national Museum of World Cultures. I'm using the Svelte framework to achieve this.
